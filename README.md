# PortableGrayMapToText
Converts a special Portable GrayMap (.pgm) picture back into a text file. The needed input-picture can be created using the code from my [TextToPortableGrayMap](https://github.com/dadul96/TextToPortableGrayMap)-repo.

### Installation
There is no installation required. Just download the exe-file (`PortableGrayMapToText.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/dadul96/PortableGrayMapToText/releases)) or compile it yourself.

### How to use
* Copy the picture with the name `input.pgm` into the same folder as the exe-file and run it.
* The output file will be called `output.txt` and stored in the same folder.

### Example
The example files can be found in the `example`-folder.
#### Screenshot of the input-picture:

#### Screenshot of the output-textfile:
